### Stripe Checkout

There are two core ways to accept payments on Stripe:

Stripe Checkout
Payment Intents API

Note: There is also a third way called Charges API. While Charges API are not deprecreated, but Stripe plans to focus product development on Payment Intents to make it the foundational Stripe API.

In this project we will use the Stripe Checkout, the quickest way to build conversion-optimized payment forms, hosted on Stripe. 

Stripe Checkout is a prebuilt payment page that you can redirect your customer to for simple purchases and subscriptions. It provides many features, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, internationalization, and form validation.
